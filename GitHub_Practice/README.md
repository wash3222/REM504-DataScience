# GitHub Practice

This is a folder where we can put some files to practice working with GitHub. Let's try the following:
1. Clone the class GitHub repository onto your computer
2. Create a Markdown file on your computer (put your name in the filename) in the GitHub_Practice directory
	* A Markdown file is simply a text file with a .md extension. GitHub knows to render markdown files as stylized text on the web.
	* Add some stuff to your markdown file to play around with the different styles (headings, bold, links).
3. Commit the change to your local repo
	* Add a commit message
	* This locks in the changes to the repo that is on your computer
4. Make a push request to send your changes up to the class repo on GitHub
	* This may take a bit while we get everybody added as contributors to the class GitHub Repo.
5. Do a Fetch to download any new changes to the repo from GitHub

## Info on Markdown Syntax
Markdown is a special syntax for creating text styling in a plain text document. Markdown is used by GitHub and also by RStudio, so it's worth knowing some of the basics.

### Headings
```
# 1st Order Heading
## 2nd Order Heading
### 3rd Order Heading
```
# 1st Order Heading
## 2nd Order Heading
### 3rd Order Heading

### Text styling
```
Emphasis/italics can be noted by *Asteriks* or _Underscores_
Bold is noted with **Double Asterisks** or __Double Undersores__
Strikethrough is done with ~~Double Tildas~~

### Lists
```
Ordered lists are made by giving a number at the beginning of the line
1. First list item
2. Second list item
Unordered lists are made by using an asterisk, plus, or minus sign at the beginning of the line
* First unordered list item
	+ Indent list items by adding spaces before the list symbol
* Remove the spaces to unindent the list item

### Links

Make links by using brackets and parentheses
[Link text](https://www.github.com)
Or just simply
[https://www/github.com]
You can also use angle brackets for links
<https://www.github.com>
