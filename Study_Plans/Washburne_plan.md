I am looking to build up my baseline proficiency and understanding of R programming. Although I started using it last semester, 
I was mostly googling my way through all my problems and did not have much oversight. I want to become a more effcient and competent 
coder - able to use 1 line of code instead of 5 (when possible) and capable of looking at a messy dataset and having my own ideas
about how to best approach exploratpry analysis. I am not sure how this study plan will advance time-wise, and I'm going to try to 
tackle the first few here shortly and see if I am overestimating my ability to get through ~2/week, or if I need to go back to the 
drawing board and cut out a few in favor of modules that build more specific skills. In the future, I will likely be working with
long-term data sets collected by remote sondes that simultaneously download various water quality parameters. Water quality data and 
pertinent weather/climate data are also often used by the type of agencies I would like to work for, making the ability to pull data
off the web another valuable skill. These data sets can be large, messy, and wrought with erroneous readings. This is why I am choosing 
to focus so much on Data Import and Cleaning. Also I'm open to ideas if anyone finds themselves enjoying other modules!
